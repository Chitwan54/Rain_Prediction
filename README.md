# Rain_Prediction

Rain Prediction is an end to end Data Science Poject. Given a set of weather conditions, predict what are the chances of raining on the given day. The project follows the following pipeline: Data Collection using Weather API, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning and preprocessing and Machine Learning modelling to predict the chances of raining on the given day. Hyperparameter tuned Light GBM model gives the best performance (recall score of ~0.97).

The Repository contains the following:

1. Data Folder : Contains 3 csv files 
2. WeatherData_Extraction: Code for Data Collection (.ipynb file)
3. Rain_Predictor: Code for EDA and Rain Prediction (.ipynb file) 
4. README.md file
